title: "Design the agent lifecycle"

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

A successful Dify agent balances experimentation with reliability. Use this lifecycle to align your team.

## 1. Discover

- Interview stakeholders to map success metrics.
- Capture user journeys and context windows in a shared Miro board.
- Draft a north-star use case and a "first useful version" milestone.

## 2. Prototype

- Spin up a sandbox dataset in Dify for synthetic conversations.
- Implement the agent in a feature flag (e.g. LaunchDarkly) for safe rollout.
- Track prompt changes in version control via `.prompt` files.

## 3. Evaluate

- Automate regression checks with Dify evaluation jobs and CI pipelines.
- Include adversarial prompts and tool failure scenarios.
- Visualize drift in a dashboard (Metabase, Grafana) to trigger alerts.

## 4. Launch & Learn

- Promote the agent to production with canary routing.
- Collect structured feedback directly from the Dify conversation history.
- Schedule weekly reviews to decide iteration priorities.

The lifecycle should loop. Each launch informs the next discovery sprint.

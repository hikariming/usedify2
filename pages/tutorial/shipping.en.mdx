## Observability checklist

- [ ] Structured logging with trace IDs propagated to Dify webhooks.
- [ ] Metrics export (latency, cost, satisfaction) to Prometheus or OpenTelemetry.
- [ ] Real-time alerting in Slack/Teams for elevated error ratios.

## Security & compliance

1. Rotate Dify API keys every 30 days.
2. Limit tool permissions with allow lists and scoped credentials.
3. Store transcripts with encryption at rest and automatic PII scrubbing.

## Launch playbook

| Phase | Owner | Actions |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Dry run | Tech lead | Replay real conversations in staging, validate responses |
| Canary | SRE | Release to 5% traffic, monitor dashboards |
| General availability | Product | Announce to users, monitor feedback loop |

Document every incident and feed learnings back into the lifecycle to keep improving quality.

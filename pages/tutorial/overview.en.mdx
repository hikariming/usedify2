Welcome to the **From Zero to Dify Agent** tutorial track. This roadmap explains how each module builds on the previous one so you can plan your learning journey.

## What you will build

By the end you will ship a production-ready agent workspace that:

1. Integrates with Dify's workflow orchestration for tool-calling agents.
2. Implements evaluation loops with datasets, feedback signals, and guardrails.
3. Deploys behind an API gateway with usage analytics and cost controls.

## Module layout

| Module | Focus | Outcomes |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| Environment setup | Toolchain, repos, quality gates | Reproducible local+cloud dev env |
| Lifecycle | Project scaffolding & domain design | Opinionated architecture for teams |
| Ship to production | Observability, scaling, compliance | Confidence to launch to users |

## Prerequisites

- Comfortable with TypeScript / Python basics.
- Access to a Dify instance (cloud or self-hosted) with API credentials.

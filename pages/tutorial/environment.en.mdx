This module ensures a reliable development environment for Dify-powered agents.

## Install prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Core tooling
brew install node pnpm python@3.10 redis

# 2. Dify CLI
pip install dify-cli

# 3. Quality gates
pnpm dlx husky-init && pnpm install
```

> **Tip:** Prefer PNPM for workspace management, especially when you scaffold multiple microservices to augment your agent.

## Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your agent repo with:

```ini
DIFY_API_BASE=https://api.dify.ai
DIFY_API_KEY=sk-...
OBSERVABILITY_ENDPOINT=https://otel.yourdomain.dev/v1/traces
```

Use separate keys for staging and production, then load them with your process manager (e.g. Docker Compose, Fly, Vercel).

## Validate connectivity

Run the quick smoke test to ensure the credentials are correct:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/ping-dify.ts
```

The script should return a `200` response along with your workspace metadata. If you see `401`, rotate the API key from the Dify console.

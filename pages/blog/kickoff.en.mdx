Welcome! This project started as an internal playbook. We decided to open-source it so every builder can accelerate their Dify journey.

## Principles

1. **Show, don't tell.** Every concept pairs with runnable examples.
2. **Multilingual first.** English and Chinese launch together to support global teams.
3. **Sustainable SEO.** We structure content with semantic headings, metadata, and keyword research so practitioners can discover us organically.

## What's next

We're working on:

- A full-stack reference implementation with Dify + Next.js + Supabase.
- Automated evaluation templates you can import into your workspace.
- Interviews with teams shipping agents in regulated industries.

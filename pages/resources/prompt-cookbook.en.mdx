Use these patterns as starting points. Tune them with your own domain data.

## Guarded research agent

```yaml
role: research-analyst
style: analytical, cite-sources
workflow:
  - gather context via web-search
  - synthesize findings into bullet summary
  - enumerate references in markdown table
constraints:
  - refuse to speculate without sources
  - inject follow-up questions when confidence < 0.6
```

## Customer support triage

```yaml
intent-detection: classification(prompt="Ticket intent", labels=["billing", "technical", "other"])
reply-template: |
  Hello {{name}},
  Thanks for reaching out about {{intent}}.
  {{solution}}
  If the issue persists, reply with "Handoff" for a human specialist.
```

Remember to version prompts by committing changes in Git and tagging releases.

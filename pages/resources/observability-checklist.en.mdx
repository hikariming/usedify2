Track these items before every launch.

### Telemetry

- [ ] Collect request/response bodies with redaction rules.
- [ ] Emit span events for tool invocations (success + failure).
- [ ] Store evaluation results alongside production metrics for correlation.

### Dashboards

- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99).
- Satisfaction scores vs. baseline.
- Cost per conversation compared with your target margin.

### Incident response

1. Document runbooks for top 5 failure modes.
2. Define on-call rotation with escalation policy.
3. Drill quarterly game days that simulate upstream outages.
